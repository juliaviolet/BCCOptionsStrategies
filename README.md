# Hedging Strategies using the Bakshi, Cao, and Chen Model

## Introduction

This project presents an in-depth exploration of various hedging strategies. The primary focus is on the Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (BCC) model, which values European options under conditions of stochastic volatility and jumps. The notebook introduces characteristic functions, option pricing techniques, and the application of the BCC model to a dataset of options and the underlying asset. Various Greeks, such as delta, vega, gamma, and theta, are computed based on changes in the asset's price. The project delves into different hedging strategies, evaluating their effectiveness and comparing their performances through visualizations.

## Sections

1. **Model Definitions**: This section elaborates on the BCC model, and several functions are defined to compute characteristic functions and option prices using this model.
  
2. **Data Import**: Option and underlying asset data from a dataset named `sorted_updated_merged_data_fixed.csv` is imported and prepared for analysis.

3. **Model Application to Data**: The BCC model is applied to the dataset, calculating various Greeks and the model prices of the options. 

4. **Hedging Strategies Analysis**: A comprehensive exploration of numerous hedging strategies is presented. The strategies include Delta Hedging, Adjusted Shadow Delta, Taleb's Adjusted Shadow Delta, Ratio Spread, Married Put, and Short Strangle.

5. **Taleb's Shadow Gamma**: An in-depth discussion on shadow gamma is provided, citing an article that explains the concept. This section emphasizes the discrete measurement of the gamma hedge in the context of hedging options. An approach for calculating the shadow gamma by adjusting the delta hedge using a gamma adjustment is described.

6. **Conclusion**: The notebook concludes with final thoughts on the effectiveness of each strategy based on the BCC model. It highlights the comparative performance of the strategies, offering insights into their advantages and use-cases for investors.

## Additional Resources

The notebook references articles and external literature, providing context and deeper insights into the methodologies used.
