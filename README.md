# BCC Options Strategies Analysis Notebook

## Introduction
This project presents an in-depth exploration of various hedging strategies, primarily focusing on the Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (BCC) model for valuing European options under conditions of stochastic volatility and jumps. Starting with model definitions, the notebook introduces the characteristic functions and option pricing techniques associated with the BCC model.

Utilizing a dataset of options and underlying asset data, the model's application computes various Greeks, such as delta, vega, gamma, and theta, based on changes in the underlying asset's price. Subsequent sections delve into different hedging strategies, evaluating their effectiveness by calculating daily profits and running balances over a specific timeframe. These strategies range from delta hedging variations to approaches like the ratio spread, married put, and short strangle. 

The notebook culminates in a visualization that compares the final balances of each strategy, offering insights into their respective performances.

## Sections
1. **Model Definitions**: The code starts by defining the BCC model to value European options under stochastic volatility and jumps.
2. **Moneyness Discussion**: A note on the relatively small vega and gamma values and their implications.
3. **Hedging Strategies Overview**: A broad overview of each strategy and its calculations, adjusting for transaction costs and dynamic market conditions.
4. **Taleb's Shadow Gamma**: A discussion on shadow gamma.
5. **Conclusion**: Final thoughts on the effectiveness of each strategy and the overall analysis.

## Additional Resources
The notebook also references articles and external literature to provide context and deeper insights into the methodologies used.
